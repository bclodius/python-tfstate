# python-tfstate 0.6.0

python-tfstate is a Python 3 library to work with Terraform state files (tfstate)

The first aim of this project is to identify every piece of data from a tfstate file.

## Python version support

python-tfstate is only being developed for Python 3.4-3.5. Ports for other Python 3 versions will be surely available when the library is more mature.

Backporting to Python 2 is at least now out of the question.

###Â Untested versions:
- Python 3.3

### Unsupported versions:
